# IIITB-Meal

A streamlit app for mess menu of IIITB. This avoids the overhead of downloading the bi-weekly menu PDFs.

NOTE: The admin side consists of a GSheet, which upon modification will update the endpoint data. For demo purposes, the menu is repeated for next 5 months, though it is flexible to fix a window to which the admin want the menu to fall in.
